I am a 3rd year PhD student in the applied mathematics program at the University of Arizona. Prior to enrolling in Arizona, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and a minor in geology from Tulane University in May 2020. Then I graduated with a Master of Science in applied mathematics from Tulane University in May 2021.

In my free time, I love hiking, camping, kayaking, climbing, playing my guitar, and spending time with my friends!
