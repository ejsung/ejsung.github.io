### Research Interests 
**History**: I have had a lifelong (since elementary school) passion in world history, particularly in the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, Middle East, and India. It would be too exhaustive to list every single culture/civilization I have a deep interest in but some of them are Bronze Age Greece (Pelasgian, Minoan, and Mycenaean), Sumerian, and Indus Valley civilizations.
