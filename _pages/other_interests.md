### Research Interests 
**History**: I have had a lifelong (since elementary school) passion in world history, particularly in the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, Middle East, and India. It would be too exhaustive to list every single culture/civilization I have a deep interest in but some of them are Bronze Age Greece (Pelasgian, Minoan, and Mycenaean), Sumerian, and Indus Valley civilizations. 

In addition, I have an equally strong interest in ancient mythologies from across the world.

I am always looking for historical texts to dive into so please feel free to recommend me good texts! 

A small, but still significant, personal dream of mine is to engage in historical research, whether it be archaeological or linguistical. Ideally, I would love to incorporate machine learning into this.
